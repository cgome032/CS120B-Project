# Concept Security System
## Project Purpose
This project was to help me learn how to use various components to create an embedded system.  

## Introduction
The security system's main purpose would be to protect a home from intruders and provide security for a family.  The servo motor acts as the door lock and a password will be inputted using the keypad. Once the system has been locked, a countdown will proceed on the led matrix and once completed, the servo motor will rotate and lock. While the motion sensor will then be active and looking for motion. If motion is detected, an alarm will go off notifying that motion has been detected and an intruder could be present. In order to unlock the system, the user will just need to input the same passcode used to lock it.

Components Used
1. LED Matrix
2. Servo Motor
3. Motion Sensor
4. Keypad
5. Speaker
6. Nokia 5110 LCD Screen
